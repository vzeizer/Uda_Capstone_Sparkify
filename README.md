# Capstone Project: Predicting Customer Churn on Sparkify

# Installations

The following packages (i.e., libraries) are necessary to successfully run this project on your local machine:

1. python >=3.6
2. numpy >= 1.19.2
3. pandas >= 1.0.1
4. PySpark >= 2.4
5. matplotlib >= 3.0


# Motivation


The main goal of this project is to create a machine learning model to predict which customer will (possibly) churn at a given time. 
If the machine learning model is capable of predicting with high reliability which customer is likely to churn, the same model applied over millions of customers should be able to save millions of dollars for (the fictitious) Sparkify by contacting these customers and offering them a discount, potentially avoiding the predicted churns to take place. 
Exploratory data analysis, feature engineering and machine learning modeling will come in handy to find a good approach to solve this problem in PySpark.
